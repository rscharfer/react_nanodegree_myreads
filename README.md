### About this Project

This is the first project of three from Udacity's React Nanodegree program. The app allows you to search for books located on an external database and add those to your book collection.  Your book collection consists of three shelves of books - want to read, read, and currently reading - and with a control you can easily move books from one shelf to another or from your search results to one of the shelves.

While completing this project, we needed to show (among other things) that we understand : 

* the use of state, and how state is passed down from parent to child,
* the use of JSX to build the UI of the app,
* and how to use React Routing to route our app.

[Additional requirements can be found in the project specification here.](requirements.pdf)


### The easiest way to view the app

* Clone the repository to your desktop
* While inside the root of the repository, tun the `$ npm install`
* After the dependencies have been installed run the command `$ npm start`
* After that, the app should run perfectly!
